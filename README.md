This is My Nguyen's submission for the Take Home Assignment by RushOrder.com

The followings are a brief description of the functionalities of the app.

Upon startup, the app will load 20 movie records from TheMovieDB.org, from the site's Popular list.

With the Floating Action Button, you can add a new movie to the list.

You can tap on a movie from the list to get to a screen where you can edit the details.

You can long click on any movie to remove it from the list.

There's also a search functionality whereby you can narrow the search to those of interest.

TODO:
* Retrieve more than 20 movie records to create a long list
* Add back arrow buttons from DetailFragment and NewFragment
* Add functionality to go from the search result screen back to the original list
* Either remove all movie posters in the main list, or load some default image for a manually added movie
* Add dependency injection
